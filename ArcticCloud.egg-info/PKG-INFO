        It has **two Classes**, they are:
        
        Class **BaseConverter**:
        
        ```
        This Module will Convert a number from the given base to any other base.
        Usage : from ArcticCloud import BaseConverter as b
        # Say, you will convert from Binary to Hexadecimal,
        v1 = b.Binary_to_Hexadecimal("11011101.111010") # bound the method calling to a variable and print it to get the desired result, 
        
        Note: Remember to give the Argument of all the functions in str, if you use any good text editor like VS Code or any IDE it will show the references while you call the method/function. 
        ```
        
        Class **MarkSheet**:

        Usage: from ArcticCloud import Marksheet as mk
        mk.PrintMarksheet("<name of school>",[<marks of 6 subjects>], ["<Name>", "<Sec>", "<Roll no>"])
